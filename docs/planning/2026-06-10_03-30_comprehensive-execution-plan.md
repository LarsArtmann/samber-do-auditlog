# Execution Plan — 2026-06-10

Comprehensive, exhaustive TODO list. Every task ≤ 12 min. Sorted by importance/impact/effort/customer-value.

**Total: 42 tasks across 5 tiers · Est. ~6h**

---

## Tier 1 — Bugs & Data Correctness (DO FIRST)

Customer-facing breakage. Ship-blocking.

| # | Task | File(s) | Est | Status |
|---|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Fix missing `<th>Health</th>` in services table — 11 `<td>` vs 10 `<th>` causes misaligned columns | `html.templ` | 2m | ❌ |
| 2 | Fix health check duration: remove per-service `HealthCheckDurationMs` from `ServiceInfo`, add `TotalHealthCheckDurationMs` to `Report` instead — current values are batch-total, misleading as per-service | `plugin.go`, `recorder.go`, `types.go` | 10m | ❌ |
| 3 | Fix health check duration: update `RecordHealthCheck` recorder to store batch total on Report, not per-service | `recorder.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 4 | Fix health check duration: update HTML stat card + remove per-service health duration column from services table | `html.templ` | 5m | ❌ |
| 5 | Fix health check duration: update tests for new field layout | `auditlog_test.go` | 8m | ❌ |
| 6 | Fix `RecordHealthCheck` creating records with empty `serviceType` — call `inferServiceType()` in that codepath too | `recorder.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 7 | Run `go generate ./...` + `go test -count=1 ./...` to verify all fixes | CLI | 2m | ❌ |

---

## Tier 2 — Type Architecture (HIGH VALUE)

Improves type safety, code quality, and visual richness. Medium effort, high payoff.

| # | Task | File(s) | Est | Status |
|---|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 8 | Define `ProviderType` named type in `types.go` with constants (`ProviderTypeLazy`, etc.) and `String()` + `Icon()` methods | `types.go` | 8m | ❌ |
| 9 | Change `ServiceInfo.ServiceType` from `string` to `ProviderType` | `types.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 10 | Change `serviceRecord.serviceType` from `string` to `ProviderType`, update `inferServiceType` to return `ProviderType` | `recorder.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 11 | Update `buildServicesLocked` to use `ProviderType`, update `newServiceRecord` | `recorder.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 12 | Add `IsHealthchecker` and `IsShutdowner` bool fields to `ServiceInfo` | `types.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 13 | Update `inferServiceType` → `inferServiceInfo` that also fetches Healthchecker/Shutdowner via `do.ExplainNamedService` | `recorder.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 14 | Update `serviceRecord` + `newServiceRecord` + `buildServicesLocked` for Healthchecker/Shutdowner fields | `recorder.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 15 | Update HTML: add 🫀 Healthchecker / 🙅 Shutdowner capability icons in services table, scope tree, graph tooltips | `html.templ` | 8m | ❌ |
| 16 | Add tests for `ProviderType` constants, `Icon()`, `String()` methods | `auditlog_test.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 17 | Add test for Healthchecker/Shutdowner capability tracking | `auditlog_test.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 18 | Run `go generate` + `go test -count=1 ./...` to verify Tier 2 | CLI | 2m | ❌ |

---

## Tier 3 — Missing Tests & Lint (QUALITY GATE)

Unblocks confidence in future changes. Low effort, high reliability payoff.

| # | Task | File(s) | Est | Status |
|---|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 19 | Add test for `Report.ServiceByName()` — found and not-found cases | `auditlog_test.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 20 | Add test for `Report.FailedServices()` — with failing and healthy services | `auditlog_test.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 21 | Add test for `Report.EventsByType()` — registration, invocation, shutdown filtering | `auditlog_test.go` | 5m | ❌ |
| 22 | Add test for `ServiceStatus.IsError()` — all 5 statuses | `auditlog_test.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 23 | Add test for `ServiceRef.String()` — root scope, named scope, empty scope | `auditlog_test.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 24 | Add test for `WriteReportJSON` error path (failing writer) | `auditlog_test.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 25 | Add test for `WriteEventsNDJSON` error path (failing writer) | `auditlog_test.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 26 | Add test for `WriteHTML` error path (failing writer) | `auditlog_test.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 27 | Add test for `writeToFile` error path (invalid directory) | `auditlog_test.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 28 | Run `golangci-lint run` on `auditlog` package only, fix formatting issues (gci) | CLI | 5m | ❌ |
| 29 | Run `go generate` + `go test -count=1 ./...` to verify Tier 3 | CLI | 2m | ❌ |

---

## Tier 4 — UX Enhancements (CUSTOMER VALUE)

Visible improvements users will notice. Medium effort.

| # | Task | File(s) | Est | Status |
|---|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 30 | Add service type filter chips to Events tab (filter by lazy/eager/transient/alias) | `html.templ` | 8m | ❌ |
| 31 | Add "Type" column to Events table showing provider type per event | `html.templ` | 5m | ❌ |
| 32 | Add service type to Event struct (`ServiceType ProviderType`) — populate in `newEvent` via lookup | `types.go`, `recorder.go` | 8m | ❌ |
| 33 | Update Events tab JS to use `service_type` from event data | `html.templ` | 5m | ❌ |
| 34 | Add health check event type filter chip + health_check badge color in Events tab | `html.templ` | 3m | ❌ |
| 35 | Run `go generate` + `go test -count=1 ./...` to verify Tier 4 | CLI | 2m | ❌ |

---

## Tier 5 — Documentation & Polish (LONG-TERM VALUE)

Keeps project healthy. Can be done incrementally.

| # | Task | File(s) | Est | Status |
|---|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 36 | Update `FEATURES.md`: add health check auditing, service type tracking, ProviderType, capabilities | `FEATURES.md` | 8m | ❌ |
| 37 | Update `TODO_LIST.md`: mark done items, add new ones from this plan | `TODO_LIST.md` | 5m | ❌ |
| 38 | Update `AGENTS.md`: ProviderType, capabilities, health check duration semantics, Tier 2 changes | `AGENTS.md` | 5m | ❌ |
| 39 | Update `doc.go`: add health checks, service type, capabilities to package description | `doc.go` | 3m | ❌ |
| 40 | Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all new features (health check, service type, ProviderType, capabilities) | `CHANGELOG.md` | 5m | ❌ |
| 41 | Add `Config.Validate() error` method + test | `plugin.go`, `auditlog_test.go` | 8m | ❌ |

## Explicitly NOT Included (deferred / rejected)

- `ReportOption` functional options — P2, ~35min, no user demand yet
- Mermaid/PlantUML export — Future, no user demand
- Versioned schema migration — Postpone to v1.0
